To Do:
1. prevent similar urls from being added(aka amazon.com vs www.amazon.com)
2. Model level rspec tests
3. Cucumber tests for index page and website submission
5. Image upload
6. Add another flash message type
7. Rspec url tests
8. Deal with banner resizing issues
9. Think about picture upload validation
10. Footer floats when no websites are displayed

Issues to discuss:
1. black links are confusing
2. picture size limit (1900x1200 => 0.5 MB jpeg)
3. display just recent upvotes or all recent activities?
